Importing numpy C API
=====================

Importing the C API module of numpy requires more code than just including a header. ``xtensor-python`` simplifies a lot
this import, however some actions are still required in the user code.

Extension module with a single file
-----------------------------------

When writing an extension module that is self-contained in a single file, its author should pay attention to the following
points:

- ``FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY`` must be defined before including any header of ``xtensor-python``.
- ``xt::import_numpy()`` must be called in the function initializing the module.

Thus the basic skeleton of the module looks like:

.. code::

    #define FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY
    #include "xtensor-python/pyarray.hpp"

    PYBIND11_MODULE(plugin_name, m)
    {
        xt::import_numpy();
        //...
    }


Extension module with multiple files
------------------------------------

If the extension module contains many source files that include ``xtensor-python`` header files, the previous points are still
required. However, the symbol ``FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY`` must be defined only once. The simplest is to define it int the file that
contains the initializing code of the module, you can then directly include ``xtensor-python`` headers in other files. Let's
illustrate this with an extension modules containing the following files:

- ``main.cpp``: initializing code of the module
- ``image.hpp``: declaration of the ``image`` class embedding an ``xt::pyarray`` object
- ``image.cpp``: implementation of the ``image`` class

The basic skeleton of the module looks like:

.. code::

    // image.hpp
    // Do NOT define FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY here
    #include "xtensor-python/pyarray.hpp"

    class image
    {
    // ....
    private:
        xt::pyarray<double> m_data;
    };

    // image.cpp
    // Do NOT define FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY here
    #include "image.hpp"
    // definition of the image class

    // main.cpp
    // FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY must be define ONCE, BEFORE including
    // any header from xtensor-python (even indirectly)
    #define FORCE_IMPORT_ARRAY
    #include "image.hpp"
    PYBIND11_MODULE(plugin_name, m)
    {
        xt::import_numpy();
        //...
    }


Using other extension modules
-----------------------------

Including an header of ``xtensor-python`` actually defines ``PY_ARRAY_UNIQUE_SYMBOL`` to ``xtensor_python_ARRAY_API``. This might
be problematic if you import another library that defines its own ``PY_ARRAY_UNIQUE_SYMBOL``, or if you define yours. If so,
you can override the behavior of ``xtensor-python`` by explicitly defining ``PY_ARRAY_UNIQUE_SYMBOL`` prior to including any
``stenxor-python`` header:

.. code::

    // in every source file
    #define PY_ARRAY_UNIQUE_SYMBOL my_uniqe_array_api
    #include "xtensor-python/pyarray.hpp"
